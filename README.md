# SuperMarket-management

During the C language programming course we were asked to create a system for managing a food store.</br>
The food store has:</br>
  *Registered customers and only they can make purchases.</br>
  *Products in stock from certain types. </br>
In the menu displayed when the program is running, you can see all the options that this system includes.</br>
If you press for exit from the store, a payment is made for all customers who have started the buying process.</br>
