# SuperMarket-management

During the C language programming course we were asked to create a system for managing a food store.</br>
The food store has:</br>
  *Registered customers and only they can make purchases.</br>
  *Products in stock from certain types. </br></br>
  <h2>Usage and options</h2>
The system includes a menu that displays a number of options to choose from.</br>
Below is the menu displayed when the program is running and after each operation is finished.</br></br>

If you press quit from the store, a payment is made for all customers who have started the buying process.</br>
