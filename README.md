# SuperMarket-management

During the C language programming course we were asked to create a system for managing a food store.
The food store has:
  *Registered customers and only they can make purchases.
  *Products in stock from certain types. 
In the menu displayed when the program is running, you can see all the options that this system includes.
If you press for exit from the store, a payment is made for all customers who have started the buying process.

This project deals with issues:
struct,
enum,
dynamic allocations,
strings,
files,
function pointer,
lists,
varidadic functions,
macros,
parametes to main,
bits.
